# Invoicing ROI Simulator â€” 3-Hour Prototype

A lightweight calculator that shows **cost savings, payback, and ROI** when moving from manual to automated invoicing. Built for speed: **React + TypeScript** SPA, **Node.js + Express** API, **MySQL** persistence, and an **email-gated report**.

## 1) Planned Approach & Architecture

### Goals
- Instant, favorable outputs that clearly show automation wins.
- Save/load/delete named scenarios in MySQL.
- Simple REST API; easy local/dev setup 
- Email-gated report (download HTML snapshot)
- Clean separation of concerns; internal constants remain server-only.
